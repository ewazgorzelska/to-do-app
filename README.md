# to-do-app

## My motivation
I chose to do this very simple app for the React.js learning purpose. First I prepared a simple data flow between components and then added another React functionality that I learned from the React.js mdn and then another, etc. The idea is basic and not really innovative but I chose it intentionally in order to be able to focus on new functionalities.

**So far it contains:**
* data flow between components (parent to child, child to parent, between siblings),
* Context API,
* React hooks: useState, useContext,
* React Portal,
* styled components library.

## Features:
- a list of tasks that can be expanded by adding new tasks,
- a click on the task marks it down as 'done',
- an 'x' button results with displaying a confirmation modal,
- confirmation modal with yes/no for removing a task from the list,
- dark/light theme switcher,
- task statistics section that counts the tasks and reveals how many tasks are on done nad open status.

To **run** this project just enter "npm start".
